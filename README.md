The Pix2pix Colorization with WGAN and U-Net project aims to enhance the performance of the Pix2pix model for colorization tasks by incorporating Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) and a U-Net architecture based on residual blocks. This project utilizes a Python notebook (.ipynb) for implementation.

## üìò Project Overview

Colorization is an important image-to-image translation task, and Pix2pix is a popular model for such tasks. However, the performance of Pix2pix can be further improved for specific applications like colorization. This project introduces two methods to enhance Pix2pix for colorization: using a WGAN architecture and implementing a U-Net with residual blocks.

WGANs employ the Wasserstein distance metric to train the generator and discriminator, leading to a more stable training process and producing realistic results. U-Net is a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture well-suited for image segmentation tasks. It incorporates skip connections and enables learning of fine details in input images.

Residual blocks, a building block for neural networks, facilitate gradient flow and accelerate convergence by utilizing skip connections within multiple layers.

Combining WGAN with a U-Net architecture based on residual blocks improves the performance of Pix2pix for colorization. It enhances stability, enables better learning of fine details, and produces high-quality colorized images.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `Pix2pix_Colorization_WGAN_UNet.ipynb`: This Python notebook serves as the core project file. It includes the implementation of the WGAN and U-Net architectures for Pix2pix colorization. The notebook provides detailed explanations, code comments, and visualizations.

- `data/`: This directory can be used to store training data for the colorization task. It should include input images and their corresponding ground truth colorized images.

- `results/`: This directory will be automatically generated when running the notebook. It stores the colorized output images and any intermediate results or visualizations.

- `README.md`: The README file provides an overview of the project and instructions for running and contributing to it.
